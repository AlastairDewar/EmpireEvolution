Remove all traces of my MySQL password and stuff, oops.
Change member logs in admin dashboard to show all changes made to administrators accounts, all changes to a user made by an administrator
Implement some for of update system, to prevent gradual changes. Maybe allow gradual changes in case of emergencies but email all super admins?
Need to make more checks that for example news titles are of a certain length and not empty etc.
Really need to plan out the bonus system
Sort out a rss feed for members, im thinking of just scrapping the one for adminstrators
Maybe draw out an object diagram?
A better understanding really wouldnt go a amiss
	Ex.	Member_model function update_name(){
							$currentMember = findMember($unique_identifier);
							if($currentMember != null){
							$currentMember->set_username($new_name);}}
	My whole code so far could be so much neater if i adopted OOP, its just so confusing with the MVC architechture
Add an API perhaps?
