<h1>Congratulations!</h1>
<h2>You have successfully checked out the repository!</h2>
<p>
	Here are some tips which may help you keep everything running smoothly and effectively.
</p>
<h3>Tip#1 Manage your configuration files</h3>
<p>
	Different servers have different configuration variables (ex: database access login). To avoid problems with servers and their different configurations variables, keep one default configuration file in the repository (ex:conig.default.ini) and for each server upload its configuration file (ex: conig.ini) manually via FTP. It is the most convenient solution to keep, if possible, configurations variables the same for each server of a project. 
</p>
<h3>Tip#2 Keep your coding in the repository </h3>
<p>
	There are many tempting situations in which you want to fix something directly on the site. Don’t do that. You may lose your changes and have a problem with backups. Keep everything in the repository. Using Springloops it’s much easier and faster to apply small and big changes to your projects. With one commit – which is a matter of one click- you can send your changes to your teammates, back up an old version and deploy a new one on your server. Keep things safe and efficient. Forget about FTP and stay away of dramas. 
</p>
<h3>Tip#3 Use the workflow </h3>
<p>
	The following simple rules make your web development easier, faster and more professional:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Commit only accomplished changes, commit frequently</li>
	<li>Update your working copy regularly</li>
	<li>Deploy to the development server firstly for early previews, deploy to the staging server for testing and clients’ previews, 
	as well as deploy to the production server when things are perfect enough.. </li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Wishing you successful development and stay Agile!</strong>
