STORYLINE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the Great War all the people of Kolarian had retreated to their own empires as they recovered from the mass losses they suffered.
 As no empire had any power left there was peace as no one had any large amount of army strength to wage a war, and so all the empires 
lived in peace, although no contact was made of each other. 
 After many years of prosperity the kings of each empire began to grow old and eventually die, leaving their lands and riches to their heirs.
 These young and naive kings had decided that their fathers ideas of peace had blinded them of the truth - that the other kings were amassing 
an army to once again launch an attack for more land. 
 As each warmongering king had the same idea they started to raise an army to conquer the lands of their enemies. And thus the begining of the 
next Great War was started...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDINGS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lumber Mill    - This building will allow the production of Lumber (resource). The building will start off producing a certain number of Wood/Lumber. 
                        Once built you will be able to recruit a number of Lumberjacks to increase the production rate depending on the level of the building (e.g. 
                        level 1 Lumber Mill will allow the recruitment of 4 lumber jacks, level 2 will allow 8 and so on)

Stonemasons - This building will act in the exact same way as the Lumber Mill with the exceptions of its production rate, this building will not be able to 
                        produce as much Stone (resource) compared to the amount of Lumber produced by the Lumber Mill. Although recruitment and building level 
                        rules are the same. 

School            - This building will allow your people to learn, teaching them science and construction skills. Doing this will open up more building options etc.
                        This building will give access to skills which a King may invest in. Each skill will be able to be upgraded to level 5/10 once this building is built.

College         - This building is upgraded from the school, which will have to be built in order for this building to be open to you. Once built all skills will be able 
                       to be upgraded to level 8/10.

University      - This building is upgraded from the college, which will have to be built in order for this building to be open to you. Once built all skills will be able
                       to be upgraded to level 10/10.

Wooden Wall - This building will be the first line of defense an Empire will have. It will provide a simple wall in wich to keep invaders out, giving low defense. 
                        It will have 4 Arrow towers. The wall will give a small number of defense. Archers may be recruited to garrison the towers adding to the defense.
                        The Wooden Wall may be upgraded to give more defense and increasing the effectiveness of the archers, increaseing the amount of defense
                        each archer gives. It may be upgraded to level 5/10. 

Stone Wall    - This building is upgraded from the Wooden Wall. When purchased the Wooden Wall will be taken apart and replaced with a Stone Wall. The Stone
                       Wall works the same way as the Wooden Wall, but It has more defense and has an extra 2 Arrow Towers, giving a total of 6 Arrow Towers. This 
                       building provides more defense than a level 5 Wooden Wall (which will be required to build this). The effectiveness of the archers is increased again
                       as the same way as upgrading them would do. This building can be upgraded to level 8/10.

Castle/Fort   - This building is upgraded from the Stone Wall. When purchased, instead of taking down the Stone Wall, it is simply fortified, with extra walls and a Castle. 
                       Also another 2 extra Arrow Towers will be built, giving a total of 8 Arrow Towers. All defense increases will be the same as before and this building 
                       will be able to be upgraded to level 10/10.

Fletcher       - This building will allow the recruitment of archer and crossbowmen regiments once a Barracks is built. The quality of the bows and crossbows produced 
                      will effect the regiments that use them. Upgrading the level of this building will strengthen your regiments. 

Blacksmith   - This building will allow the recruitment of Swordsmen, Knights and Pikemen once a Barracks is built. Also this building will allow the production of unit 
                       add-ons (e.g. Iron or Steel armour, which can be equiped by your regiments). As with a Fletcher, upgrading the level of this building will strengthen your
                       regiments and give access to more add-ons. 

Barracks       - This building will allow The recruitment of an army providing the requirements are met. This building can be upgraded to level 10/10, which will be required 
                       to recruit higher ranked regiments.

Rogue's        - This building will provide the empire with Infiltration. Which, depending on the amount of it an empire has will allow a king to scout out another empire to gain  
Guild               information. The Guild will be able to recruit Rogues to increase the number of infiltration which will mean you're more likely to get information. This building,
                      like the bank, will not be upgraded but will depend on the level of an empires Scouting. (This is maybe something we can add later?)

Bank            - This building will allow the King of an Empire to store a certain amount of Gold safely away, so if the empire was raided then they could not steal gold 
                       from the Bank. This building cannot be upgraded, the maximum amount allowed to be stored will depend on the level of an empires economic level. 
                       Although handy, the bank will take up to 8 hours untill the next deposit can be made. Although you can withdraw Gold at any time.  

Treasury       - This building requires the bank to be built first. The Treasury will increase the amount of gold an empire produces. This building cannot be upgraded and 
                       once built cannot be of anymore use.

Market          - Not all empires belong to warmongering kings and some belong to those who wish to live alongside each other. This building will allow an empire to sell 
                       items (add-ons) and regiments to each other. The price will be set by the king who is selling it. (This is maybe something we can add in later?) 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESOURCES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gold     - Main resource in the game. It will be provided entirely by taxing your empire, no building will be required to gain a productive rate of Gold.

Lumber - The second resource in the game. Although needed at the beginning, will become less important later on. Will be provided by the Lumber Mill.

Stone   - The last resource in the game. This resource will be needed more later on in the game. It's hard to produce so the production rate will be slower 
               than that of Gold and Lumber. Will be provided by the Stonemason.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gold     - Building, researching, purchasing

Lumber - Building, purchasing

Stone   - Building, purchasing (maybe)
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The production of resources:

Gold     - 1 Gold every 3 second to begin with. This will mean 6,000 Gold every turn (30 minutes)

Lumber - 1 Lumber every 10 seconds to begin with. This will mean 1,800 Lumber every turn (30 minutes)

Stone   - 1 Stone every 18 seconds to begin with. This will mean 1,000 Stone every turn (30 minutes)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
